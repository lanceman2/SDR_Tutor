    <h1>Signal Dimensions</h1>

    <p>
    In SDR (software defined radio) we tend to used two dynamical
    variables to describe our radio signal, whatever that is.  As a
    dynamicist we must ask ourselves why two variables, why not one, or
    maybe three.  The choose of the number of dynamical variables must
    have a reason.  As a physicist we must see this number of dimensions
    as the solution to an optimization problem, it can't just be
    arbitrary.
    </p>

    <p>
    We'll look at two approaches to finding the number of dimensions.
    First we'll consider looking at the wave signal as a some kind of
    indirect measurement at one point in space of an induced electric
    potential due to the point being in proximity to an electromagnetic
    field.  We know that the lowest fidelity model for this induced
    potential will be of the form of a second order different equation,
    and hence we get a degree of dynamical freedom for each order of the
    differential system, so there are two dynamical
