    <h1>Signal Dimensions</h1>

    <p>
    This page is likely total rubbish; just the product of an idiot trying
    to get perspective.  Don't belief what you read.  Belief is for
    dummies.

    In SDR (software defined radio) we tend to use two dynamical variables
    to describe our radio signal, whatever that is.  As dynamicists we
    must ask ourselves why two variables, why not one, three, or four.
    The choose of the number of dynamical variables must have a reason.
    As a physicist we must see this number of dimensions as the solution
    to an optimization problem like all of physics, it can't just be
    arbitrary.  i.e. I'm not an engineer, I need more/deeper incite.

    We'll look at two approaches to finding the number of dimensions.
    First we'll consider looking at the wave signal as a some kind of
    indirect measurement at one point in space of an induced electric
    potential due to the point being in proximity to an electromagnetic
    (EM) field.  We know that the lowest fidelity model for this induced
    potential will be of the form of a second order differential equation,
    and hence we get a degree of dynamical freedom for each order of the
    differential system, so there are two dynamical variables.  If we add
    more physical measurement points of electric potential we could think
    about it as adding more degrees of freedom, if the points are located
    in physical space such that they are observing different independent
    modes in the EM fields that induce the electric potentials.
    As we know, adding more (synced) SDR hardware devices is a thing.
    It's likely that there will be overlay in the information gotten from
    two measurement points close to each other; that is there may be some
    redundancy causing there to be effectively less degrees of freedom.
    Okay so, can we have factional degrees of freedom?  Note, we do have
    factional calculus to use as a tool.
    </p>

    <p>
    The thing that gets me is that the EM fields are so complex and high
    dimensional, but in the signal processing realm we are just looking at
    signals that have only two degrees of dynamical freedom.  Using these
    wave signals we are only looking at a sampling of two degrees of
    freedom.  Maybe that makes sense from the prospective of the EM wave
    fields are generated by a transmitter with that same 2D prospective
    and the EM field pattern in x, y, z, space that are produced by the
    transmitter are just evolving two dimensionally in time.  That is, at
    any point in x, y, z, space there are field values that are evolving
    in time by a two dimensional ODE (ordinary differential equation), or
    put another way, we have a second order differential equation at a
    point in x, y, z space.
    </p>

    <p>
    Okay so what's the other approach?  I was thinking that we could
    imperially derive the model of what a wave signal is.  Maybe by
    studying the dynamics of IQ data like they are phase space variables
    evolving do to inputs that cause them to evolve.  It's just physics
    classical mechanics, but it's not near that clean because there is
    noise in the signal.  We'll need to add a notion of noise to this
    model.  If we manage to find a perfect model for the noise it would no
    longer be so "noise like".  Today they use different categories of
    noise to improve "signal models".
    </p>

    <p>
    In the absence of noise, can we "prove" that a "simple radio" problem
    is two dimensional; that is can be modeled well by a second order
    ODE?  Yes, this would be in some kind of idealized universe.  One
    transmitter putting out a composed signal that is received by a
    receiver.  If we replace the EM field with an some kind of ideal wire
    will the transmitted signal be the same as the received signal?
    Without noise, maybe this is true for case with using EM fields.
    Clearly I've never studied antenna theory.
    Why can't a receiver just receive the signal that is transmitted?
    Kind of like:
  
    $$ T(t) = a R(t - t_d) \label{TR}$$

    where \(T(t)\) is the transmitted
    signal as a function of time, \(t\), \(a\) is an attenuation constant
    that is less then one, and \(R(t)\) is the received signal as a
    function of time that is an earlier time differing by a time delay of
    \(t_d\) which is a positive constant.
    The received signal is just a smaller and time delayed copy of the
    transmitted signal.
    </p>

    <p>
    But reality is not so kind to us.  Changes have inertial mass and
    forces applied to them from the EM fields and hence equation
    \ref{TR} has got to be wrong.  The question is just how wrong is it.
    To what level is it an approximation to what happens.
    If the changes can move freely enough, equation \ref{TR} may be a good
    approximation.
